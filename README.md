## About me

I’m a recent graduate from the University of Melbourne with a Master’s degree in Software Engineering. During my time at university, I engaged in several projects, taking on roles that spanned front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.The excitement of solving complex problems and seeing my solutions streamline processes and enhance project outcomes is what drives my passion for coding. I am passionate about writing clean and efficient code, and I am ready to explore new challenges and enhance my skills. I am keen to expand my portfolio and engage in projects that are both innovative and impactful.
